# Healthcare Recruitment Website - Deployment Instructions

## 📁 Files Ready for Upload

Your website has been successfully built and exported as static files. All the files you need to upload to your server are located in the **`out/`** directory.

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Locate the Export Files
All deployable files are in: `/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/upstaffing/healthcare-recruitment/out/`

### Step 2: Upload to Your Server
1. **Compress the contents** of the `out/` folder (not the folder itself, just its contents)
2. **Upload** all files to your web server's public directory (usually `public_html/`, `www/`, or similar)
3. **Extract** the files in your server's root directory

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- Visit your domain to see the homepage
- Test all pages: `/about/`, `/apply/`, `/contact/`, `/industries/`
- Ensure mobile responsiveness works correctly
